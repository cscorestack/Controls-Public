  "Control Name": "3.1.8 The application can operation with reduced functionality or degraded performance in the case of an outage.Avoiding failure is impossible in the public cloud, and as a result applications require resilience to respond to outages and deliver reliability. The application should therefore be designed to operate even when impacted by regional, zonal, service or component failures across critical application scenarios and functionality.",
