Some companies, whose primary audience is internal and are salary-based, may base their thresholds on the user's mental capacity to sit at the application screen. Other customers that have service-related users (i.e. users who are paid for performance) may base their thresholds on the ability to keep the user working as fast as possible (mental state is not the primary motivator) because increased productivity typically increases revenue.",
