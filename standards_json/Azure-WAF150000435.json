  "Control Statement": "Data exfiltration occurs when an internal/external malicious actor performs and unauthorized data transfer. The solution should leverage a layered approach such as, hub/spoke for network communications with deep packet inspection to detect/protect from a data exfiltration attack. Azure Firewall, UDR (User-defined Routes), NSG (Network Security Groups), Key Protection, Data Encryption, PrivateLink, and Private Endpoints are layered defenses for a data exfiltration attack. Azure Sentinel and Azure Security Center can be used to detect data exfiltration attempts and alert incident responders.",
