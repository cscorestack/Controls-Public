  "Control Statement": "Research and understand the various design patterns and services that help improve workload performance. As part of the analysis, identify what you could trade to achieve higher performance. For example, using a cache service can help to reduce the load placed on database systems; however, it requires some engineering to implement safe caching or possible introduction of eventual consistency in some areas.",
