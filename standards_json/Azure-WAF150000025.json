  "Control Family": "1. Cost Optimization", 
  "Control Statement": "In order to successfully maintain the application it's important to 'turn the lights on' and have clear visibility of important metrics both in real-time and historically. Log aggregation technologies, such as Azure Log Analytics or Splunk, should be used to collate logs and metrics across all application components for subsequent evaluation. Resources may include Azure IaaS and PaaS services as well as 3rd-party applications such as firewalls or anti-malware solutions used in the application. For instance, if Azure Event Hub is used, the Diagnostic Settings should be configured to push logs and metrics to the data sink. Understanding usage helps with right-sizing of the workload, but additional cost for logging needs to be accepted and included in the cost model.",
