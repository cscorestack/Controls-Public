  "Control Name": "INCIDENT HANDLING", 
  "Control Family": "INCIDENT RESPONSE", 
  "Control Statement": "The organization:a. Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;b. Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; andc. Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.Supplemental Guidance:  Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function). Related controls: AU-6, CM-6, CP-2, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.References: Executive Order 13587; NIST Special Publication 800-61.",
