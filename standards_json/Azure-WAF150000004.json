  "Control Name": "1.1.4 There is a well-understood capacity model for the workload.", 
  "Control Family": "1. Cost Optimization", 
  "Control Statement": "A capacity model should describe the relationships between the utilization of various components as a ratio, to capture when and how application components should scale-out. For instance, scaling the number of Application Gateway v2 instances may put excess pressure on downstream components unless also scaled to a degree. When modelling capacity for critical system components it is therefore recommended that an N+1 model be applied to ensure complete tolerance to transient faults, where N describes the capacity required to satisfy performance and availability requirements. This also prevents cost-related surprises when scaling out and realizing that multiple services need to be scaled at the same time.",
