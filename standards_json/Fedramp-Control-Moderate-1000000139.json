  "Control Statement": "The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged accounts.Supplemental Guidance:  Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay- resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.",
