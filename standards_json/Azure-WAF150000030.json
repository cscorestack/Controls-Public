  "Control Statement": "Moving data between regions can add additional cost - both on the storage layer and networking layer. It's worth reviewing if this cost is justified or can be replaced via re-architecture or justified due to e.g. disaster recovery (DR). If applications or services are exchanging data between regions, extra cost is typically accrued.",
