  "Control Name": "5.12.9 Permissions to Azure workloads are rarely based on individual resources and custom permissions are rarely used.", 
  "Control Family": "5. Security", 
  "Control Statement": "Custom resource-based permissions are often not needed and can result in increased complexity and confusion as they do not carry the intention to new similar resources. This then accumulates into a complex legacy configuration that is difficult to maintain or change without fear of \"breaking something\" - negatively impacting both security and solution agility. Higher level permissions sets - based on resource groups or management groups - are usually more efficient.",
