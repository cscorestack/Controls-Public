  "Control Statement": "Branch policies provide additional level of control over the code which is committed to the product. It is a common practice to not allow pushing against the main branch and require pull-request (PR) with code review before merging the changes by at least one reviewer, other than the change author. Different branches can have different purposes and access levels, for example: feature branches are created by developers and are open to push, integration branch requires PR and code-review and production branch requires additional approval from a senior developer before merging.",
