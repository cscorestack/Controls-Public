  "Control Statement": "Landing Zone refers to components that are already defined and in place before the workloads are getting deployed by the workload owners, e.g. network topology with Hub/Spoke concept. The purpose of the \"Landing Zone\" is to ensure that when a workload lands on Azure, the required \"plumbing\" is already in place, providing greater agility and compliance with enterprise security and governance requirements. It is crucial that a Landing Zone will be handed over to the workload owner with the security guardrails deployed.",
