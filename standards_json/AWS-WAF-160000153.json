  "Control Statement": "Hard real-time distributed systems require responses to be given synchronously and rapidly, while soft real-time systems have a more generous time window of minutes or more for response. Oï¬„ine systems handle responses through batch or asynchronous processing. Hard real-time distributed systems have the most stringent reliability requirements.",
