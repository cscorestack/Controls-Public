  "Control Family": "Reliability",
  "Control Statement": "These are rapid processes that may mitigate availability impact on your workload. They can be operated in the absence of a root cause. An ideal emergency lever reduces the cognitive burden on the resolvers to zero by providing fully deterministic activation and deactivation criteria. Example levers include blocking all robot traï¬ƒc or serving a static response. Levers are often manual, but they can also be automated.",
