  "Control Name": "5.10.6 Data in transit is encrypted.", 
  "Control Family": "5. Security", 
  "Control Statement": "When data is being transferred between components, locations, or programs, it's in transit. Data in transit should be encrypted using a common encryption standard at all points to ensure data integrity. For example: web applications and APIs should use HTTPS/SSL for all communication with clients and also between each other (in micro-services architecture). Determine if all components in the solution are using a consistent standard. There are times when encryption is not possible due to technical limitations, but the reason needs to be clear and valid.",
