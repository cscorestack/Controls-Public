  "Control Statement": "There is almost no limit to how much an application can be performance-tuned. How do you know when you have tuned an application enough? It really comes down to the 80/20 rule--generally, 80% of the application can be optimized by focusing on just 20%. While you can continue optimizing certain elements of the application, after optimizing the initial 20%, a company typically sees a diminishing return on any further optimization.",
