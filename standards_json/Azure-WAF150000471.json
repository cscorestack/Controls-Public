  "Control Family": "5. Security", 
  "Control Statement": "Organizations should rarely develop and maintain their own encryption algorithms. Secure standards already exist on the market and should be preferred. AES should be used as symmetric block cipher, AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 are acceptable. Crypto APIs built into operating systems should be used where possible, instead of non-platform crypto libraries. For .NET make sure you follow the .NET Cryptography Model.",
