  "Control Statement": "The information system, for PKI-based authentication: (a)   Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information; (b)   Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key; (c)   Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and (d)   Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the network.Supplemental Guidance:  Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, validation of certifications involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor including certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.",
