  "Control Name": "3.11.2 You know how to handle high CPU or memory situations.", 
  "Control Family": "3. Performance Efficiency", 
  "Control Statement": "If the application has very high CPU or memory utilization, then consider scaling the application either horizontal or vertical. Scaling horizontal to more compute resources will spread the load across more machines. This will, however, increase the network complexity as there will be more machines to support the system. Scaling the application vertical to a larger machine this is optimized for higher CPU or memory workloads may also be considered. Profiling the application code can be useful to find code structures that may be sub-optimal and replace them with better-optimized code. These decisions are a balance of several factors that can include cost, system complexity, and time to implement.",
