  "Control Statement": "The organization: a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access; and b. Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.Supplemental Guidance:  Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, CA-7, CM-8, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, PL-4, SI-4.References: NIST Special Publications 800-48, 800-94, 800-97.",
