  "Control Statement": "The organization: a. Establishes personnel security requirements including security roles and responsibilities for third-party providers; b. Requires third-party providers to comply with personnel security policies and procedures established by the organization; c. Documents personnel security requirements; d. Requires third-party providers to notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of any personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials and/or badges, or who have information system privileges within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and e.

Notifications of third-party personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and credentials. Organizations define the transfers and terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics that include, for example, functions, roles, and nature of credentials/privileges associated with individuals transferred or terminated. Related controls: PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, PS-5, PS-6, SA-9, SA-21.Control Enhancements:  None.References:  NIST Special Publication 800-35.",
