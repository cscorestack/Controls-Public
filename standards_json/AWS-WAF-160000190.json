  "Control Family": "Reliability",
  "Control Statement": "Bimodal behavior is when your workload exhibits diï¬€erent behavior under normal and failure modes, for example, relying on launching new instances if an Availability Zone fails. You should instead build workloads that are statically stable and operate in only one mode. In this case, provision enough instances in each Availability Zone to handle the workload load if one AZ were removed and then use Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon Route 53 health checks to shift load away from the impaired instances.",
