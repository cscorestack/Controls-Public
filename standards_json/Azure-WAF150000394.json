  "Control Statement": "The threat modeling tool will produce a report of all the threats identified. This report is typically uploaded into a tracking tool or work items that can be validated and addressed by the developers. Cyber security teams can also use the report to determine attack vectors during a penetration test. As new features are added to the solution, the threat model should be updated and integrated into the code management process. If a security issue is found, there should be a process to triage the issue into the next release cycle or a faster release, depending on the severity.",
