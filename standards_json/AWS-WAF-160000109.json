  "Control Statement": "Group components that share reachability requirements into layers. For example, a database cluster in a VPC with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. In a serverless workload operating without a VPC, similar layering and segmentation with microservices can achieve the same goal.",
