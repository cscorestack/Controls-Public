  "Control Statement": "OAuth tokens are usually cached after they've been acquired. Application code should first try to get tokens silently from a cache before attempting to acquire a token from the identity provider, to optimise performance and maximize availability. Tokens should be stored securely and handled as any other credentials. When there's a need to share tokens across application servers (instead of each server acquiring and caching their own) encryption should be used.",
