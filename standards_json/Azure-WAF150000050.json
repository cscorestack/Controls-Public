  "Control Family": "1. Cost Optimization", 
  "Control Statement": "Purchasing reserved instances is a way to reduce Azure costs for workloads with stable usage. You have to manage utilization: if it's too low then you are paying for resources that are not being used. One advice is to keep RI instances simple and not trying to have too much management overhead that has to be factored in as part of the cost.",
