  "Control Family": "2. Operational Excellence", 
  "Control Statement": "Azure Resource Health Alerts should be configured for specific resource groups and resource types, and should be adjusted to maximize signal to noise ratios, i.e. only distribute a notification when a resource becomes unhealthy according to the application health model or due to an Azure platform-initiated event. It is therefore important to consider transient issues when setting an appropriate threshold for resource unavailability, such as configuring an alert for a virtual machine with a threshold of 1 minute for unavailability before an alert is triggered.",
