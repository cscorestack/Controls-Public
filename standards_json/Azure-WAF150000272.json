  "Control Family": "3. Performance Efficiency", 
  "Control Statement": "Similar to previous questions regarding the initial connection to a service, you will also want to understand how long it takes for the server to receive, process, and then return data. This round-trip can also help ensure that enough hardware resources have been assigned to the environment. Additionally, it is possible to identify 'noisy neighbors', applications running on the same disk (typically in a virtualized environment) or sharing the same network, that are consuming available resources.",
