  "Control Family": "Reliability",
  "Control Statement": "If the workload is unable to respond successfully to a request, then fail fast. This allows the releasing of resources associated with a request, and permits the service to recover if it’s running out of resources. If the workload is able to respond successfully but the rate of requests is too high, then use a queue to buﬀer requests instead. However, do not allow long queues that can result in serving stale requests that the client has already given up on.",
