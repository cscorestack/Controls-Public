  "Control Statement": "A holistic application health model should be used to quantify what 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' states represent across all application components. It is highly recommended that a 'traffic light' model be used to indicate a green/healthy state when key non-functional requirements and targets are fully satisfied and resources are optimally utilized, e.g. 95% of requests are processed in <= 500ms with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node utilization at x%.",
