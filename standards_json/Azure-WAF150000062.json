  "Control Statement": "There are cost implications to using Front Door with Web Application Firewall enabled, but it can save costs compared to using a 3rd party solution. Front Door has a good latency, because it uses unicast. If only 1 or 2 regions are required, Application Gateway can be used. There are cost implications of having a WAF - you should check pricing of hours and GB/s.",
