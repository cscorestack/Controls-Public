  "Control Statement": "In order to successfully maintain the application it's important to 'turn the lights on' and have clear visibility of important metrics both in real-time and historically. Log aggregation technologies, such as Azure Log Analytics or Splunk, should be used to collate logs and metrics across all application components for subsequent evaluation.
