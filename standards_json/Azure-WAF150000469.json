  "Control Family": "5. Security", 
  "Control Statement": "Network-based data loss prevention (DLP) is decreasingly effective at identifying both inadvertent and deliberate data loss. The reason for this is that most modern protocols and attackers use network-level encryption for inbound and outbound communications. While the organization can use \"SSL-bridging\" to provide an \"authorized man-in-the-middle\" that terminates and then reestablishes encrypted network connections, this can also introduce privacy, security and reliability challenges.",
