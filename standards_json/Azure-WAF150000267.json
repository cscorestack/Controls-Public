  "Control Family": "3. Performance Efficiency", 
  "Control Statement": "There are many types of goals when determining baselines for application performance. Perhaps baselines center around a certain number of visitors within a given time period, the time it takes to render a page, type required for executing a stored procedure, or a desired number of transactions if your site conducts some type of e-commerce. It is important to identify and maintain a shared understanding of these baselines so that you can architect a system that meets them.",
