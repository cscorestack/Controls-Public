  "Control Family": "2. Operational Excellence", 
  "Control Statement": "Are the dashboards openly available in your organization or do you limit access based on roles etc.? For example: developers usually don't need to know the overall cost of Azure for the company, but it might be good for them to be able to watch a particular workload. Access to operational and financial data should be tightly controlled to align with segregation of duties, while making sure that it doesn't hinder operational effectiveness; i.e. scenarios where developers have to raise an ticket to access logs should be avoided.",
