  "Control Statement": "Benchmarking enables security program improvement by learning from external organizations. It lets the organization know how its current security state compares to that of other organizations. As an example, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has created security benchmarks for Azure that map to the CIS Control Framework. Another reference example is the MITRE ATT&CKT framework that defines the various adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.",
