To prevent accidental/undesired modification of resources, Azure offers the locking functionality where only specific roles and users with permissions are able to delete/modify resources. Locks can be used on critical parts of the infrastructure, but special care needs to be taken in the DevOps process - modification locks can sometimes block automation.",
