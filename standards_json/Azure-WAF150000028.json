  "Control Name": "1.4.2 There is an availability strategy defined and cost implications of it are understood.", 
  "Control Family": "1. Cost Optimization", 
  "Control Statement": "An availability strategy should capture how the application remains available when in a failure state and should apply across all application components and the application deployment stamp as a whole such as via multi-geo scale-unit deployment approach. There are cost implications as well: More resources need to be provisioned in advance to provide high availability. Active-active setup, while more expensive than single deployment, can balance cost by lowering load on one stamp and reducing the total amount of resources needed.",
